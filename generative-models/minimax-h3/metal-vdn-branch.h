// VDN-H3's hybrid attention as a component: the weights of one block's
// linear branch, the scratch it needs, and the dispatch sequence.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a model -- it has no forward of its own
// and no q/k/v. VDN's branch shares the BACKBONE's projections, reading
// the raw pre-QK-norm, pre-RoPE q/k/v that H3's attention already
// computes, which is why its width is exactly H3's 56 x 128 and why one
// LoRA on attn.orig.to_{q,k,v} feeds both halves of the hybrid. So this
// takes those tensors as inputs and hands back the readout the caller
// adds to its own attention output, on VIDEO rows only:
//
//     out = orig.to_out(softmax_gate(x) * window_softmax(q, k, v))
//           + to_out_linear(branch_readout)          <- video rows only
//
// WEIGHTS COME FROM THE MANAGER, per the WeightSet contract: the loader
// takes a shared_ptr and keeps it for its own lifetime, because the
// buffers it hands out are refcounted aliases of the set's. The
// checkpoint is bf16 and every kernel here is fp32 -- A is the matrix
// the solve inverts and bf16 loses the symmetry it depends on -- so the
// reads go through derived(), which is the accessor for a KEPT
// TRANSFORM. The key names the dtype, since that is what changes the
// bytes.
//
// ONE ENCODER, NO FENCES. The whole branch, scan included, is a run of
// dispatches on a single ComputeEncoder: Metal's serial dispatch type
// orders them, so the frame recurrence needs no commit between steps.
// The frame LOOP is on the host because a head's [128, 128] fp32 state
// is 64 KB against a 32 KB threadgroup budget -- no threadgroup can own
// a head across frames, so the ordering has to be the queue's.
