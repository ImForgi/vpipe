// An ANE-resident compute module: a CoreML graph whose SHAPE is fixed
// at build time and whose WEIGHTS are stamped in from the caller's own
// buffers at model load.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On an M4 the GPU has no int8 path at all (integer
// MAD runs 2.0 TOP/s against 7.94 TFLOP/s f16 -- a quarter rate), and
// the f16 GEMM path is already at 84-92% of its roofline, so there is
// no lever left on the GPU. The ANE is the only unused compute on the
// die, and on DiT-shaped work it delivers ~14 TOPS against the GPU's
// achieved 6.6-7.3 -- about 2x here and closer to 4x on a base M4,
// which carries the SAME 16-core ANE against roughly half the GPU.
//
// WHAT THE ANE WANTS (all measured, M4 Pro, fp16):
//
//   * a weight-dedicated on-chip buffer of ~8-10 MB. Per-op weights
//     under it run 16-17 TOPS; over it the rate falls off a cliff
//     (8.4 MB 16.8, 11.8 MB 12.2, 50 MB 4.2).
//   * activation streaming proportional to M*(K+N), so at a fixed K*N
//     the rate is SYMMETRIC in K and N and peaks at K == N.
//   * M >= ~2048, because the weight load amortises over rows. The
//     dataflow is weight-stationary: the buffer holds the WEIGHT, and
//     the cliff does not move when M changes.
//
// So a big matmul is emitted as an explicit (Bm,Bk,Bn) tiling inside
// ONE graph. Tiles over M and N are independent; the K loop
// accumulates, and accumulation is CHEAP -- squareness matters far
// more. A Krea-2 FFN tiled (4096,2048,2048) measures 14.2 TOPS against
// 2.7 monolithic, while a tiling contorted to avoid K-splits entirely
// (Bk=6144, Bn=512) manages only 4.3.
//
// KEEP A WHOLE BLOCK IN ONE MODULE. predict() carries ~1.1-2.3 ms of
// fixed cost, so granularity is set by amortising THAT: a whole FFN
// (825 GFLOP, ~50 ms) sits at 2-4% overhead and a whole block (1649
// GFLOP) at 1-2%. Per-tile dispatch is hopeless. The GPU<->ANE
// crossing itself is FREE -- measured at -0.3 to -1.0 ms against a
// GPU-only control with the same commit count, i.e. the ANE phase
// overlaps the GPU's commit/wait rather than serialising behind it --
// so a design does NOT have to avoid crossings.
//
// WHY WEIGHTS ARE STAMPED RATHER THAN PASSED. CoreML will accept the
// weight as a runtime INPUT and the op still lands on the ANE, but it
// then re-stages the weight per internal M-tile and costs ~37% (9-10
// TOPS against 14). A baked weight keeps the full rate. The price is
// an ANE compile at load, ~34 ms per MB -- which is recoverable: the
// compile runs in ANECompilerService.xpc at about one core, and
// parallelises ~2.3x across processes. Run it while the ANE is IDLE
// (GPU-only warmup steps) and it is free; running it UNDER ANE
// inference costs the inference 1.34x, so do not interleave.
//
// THE TEMPLATE. Building a CoreML graph needs coremltools, which is
// not a runtime dependency here -- so the graph is produced OFFLINE by
// tools/make_ane_module.py as a compiled .mlmodelc with dummy weights,
// and this class only stamps real bytes into it. That works because
// the weight blob is a plain index of raw row-major arrays: a 64-byte
// file header, then per weight a 64-byte entry header (magic
// 0xdeadbeef, byte size at +8, data offset at +16) followed by the
// data verbatim -- no permutation, no compression, no padding. The
// hardware's internal tiling is applied by the driver at load, which
// is also why the declared layout (NN vs NT) measures identically.
//
// That layout is UNDOCUMENTED. parse_weight_blob() therefore validates
// the magic, the entry count and the size arithmetic on every load and
// fails loudly rather than stamping bytes into a format that moved
// under a macOS update. A caller that gets `false` should fall back to
// its GPU path, not proceed.
